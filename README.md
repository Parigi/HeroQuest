# HeroQuest
A simple Java game

## Description
I made this game in 2019 as a project for a Object Oriented Programmation course (University of Modena).
Is a really basilar game written in Java (libraries: Swing and AWT). 
The objective was understanding the basics of an OO language.

It was also good for **learning how animations and collisions works**. 


## How to Run
Run the file Game.java in Main package.
